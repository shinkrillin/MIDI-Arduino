# MIDI-Arduino
This is where I'll be playing with the Arduino as a MIDI instrument.

Ideally, the end result will be a modular system of MIDI playthings with the central piece being an Arduino Mega in an enclosure with some support hardware.

I'll commit this extended version to the master when I've had a chance to test it on the hardware.
